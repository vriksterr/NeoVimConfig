# NeoVimConfig
This Repo Contains the Preinstalled files for neovim and the config files that i have configured i think its complete with all the feaeture once can need but there are some things missing like support for many other programing lang but its set for C++ completely

In Future the TO do parts
- add dap config so it finds the exe file automatically.
- to add support for more programming languages.
